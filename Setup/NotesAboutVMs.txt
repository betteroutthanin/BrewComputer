
******************** SSH connections
VirtualBox will create a private network (10.0.2.x) which will be connected to
your host network using NAT. (Unless configured otherwise.) This means that 
you cannot directly access any host of the private network from the host 
network. To do so, you need some port forwarding. In the network preferences 
of your VM you can, for example, configure VirtualBox to open port 22 on 
127.0.1.1 (a loopback address of your host) and forward any traffic to port 22
of 10.0.2.1 (the internal address of your VM)

This way, you can point putty to Port 22 of 127.0.1.1 and VirtualBox will 
redirect this connection to your VM where its ssh daemon will answer it, 
allowing you to log in.
